# Portfolio Admin Portal
  This is a page I use to upload and delete photos from my <a href="https://github.com/RyanReedKnight/PortfolioBackend">backend of my photo portfolio webpage</a>, built with React.
The website opens to a login page, if valid credentials are provided, it recieves a JWT from the backend of the application, which it stores in memory.
From there it navigates to a page where the admin can upload and delete photos. As of now the apearence of the site is rather poor, as it is mostly just
a tool I use to upload photos to my website, though I may work to improve its apearence in the future.
